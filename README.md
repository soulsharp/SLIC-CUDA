# SuperpixelGen-using-SLIC-MT
Superpixel generation for segementation and detection done through algorithms like Simple Linear Iterative Clustering(SLIC) is resource-heavy.
The aim of this repository is to write fast code in C++ that can make this algorithm run in real-time with the ability to output >24 fps.
A huge part of the workflow will utilize only the CPU with focus on multithreading.

In the future, CUDA support might be enabled for this project.
